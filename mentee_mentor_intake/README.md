# Intake Forms

In April 2022 there was a goal to complete the user experience from the point of signing up and doing the intake form to matching a mentee with a mentor. Starting from beginning we reviewed the intake forms and started mapping where the data was going.

Please update this readme on all repositories when significant progress has been made.

## Tracking the Data Flow
Working with some front end, backend and data science students we were able to create a flowchart. This flowchart doesn't mean that the flow is working. In fact, the flow chart contains notes that we took along the way and places that we saw room for improvement.

## What has been done with the intake forms

In the review of the intake form there was difference between what was on the front end and what underdog dev was using at the time. After comparing the two intake forms with the technical project managers and Paul St. German, there was a meeting with Jason on 4/25/2022.

[Here is a link to the Intake Form with the comments and decisions.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rm5s7upr0tZDUABbsHwqZMfyUekKLvE9Hfua4XYzPxM/edit?usp=sharing)

The sheets called Mentee 2.0 and Mentor 2.0 are the results from that first 30 minute meeting with Jason. After that meeting there were some more questions asked in the stakeholder meeting on 4/27/2022 before tickets were created to start working.
